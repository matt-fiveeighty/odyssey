# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-23)

**Core value:** Every number is real, every recommendation is specific to you, and the system actively works for you between visits -- like a fiduciary managing your hunting portfolio, not a spreadsheet you maintain yourself.
**Current focus:** v1.0 shipped. Planning next milestone.
