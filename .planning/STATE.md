# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Infrastructure-first ordering -- VerifiedDatum + Redis before any user-facing features
- [Roadmap]: Split Calendar (Phase 3) and ICS Subscription (Phase 4) into separate phases for independent delivery
- [Roadmap]: Split Phase 7 three ways -- Savings (Phase 8), Diff (Phase 9), Scouting (Phase 10) for independent validation
- [Roadmap]: SCRP + FRESH kept together (Phase 7) since freshness badges are meaningless without enriched scrapers
- [01-02]: All modules share single Redis client via getRedis() from src/lib/redis.ts
- [01-02]: Cache helpers degrade gracefully (null on get, no-op on set/del) when Redis unavailable

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- pdf-parse v2 table extraction quality is unvalidated against actual state draw PDFs (affects Phase 7)
- Amadeus SDK v11 compatibility with Next.js 16 server components is unverified (affects Phase 6)
- Google Calendar subscription refresh behavior (12-24h) means no real-time calendar updates (affects Phase 4 user-facing copy)
